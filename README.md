# Some-code-from-my-app

I can't make the full app repo public because someone else may finish it and upload it to the app store before I do. If after I have  uploaded it to the app store and either A) have millions of dedicated users, or B) have 0 users for years, I will consider making it public. 

Even if I have millions of users, I may still keep it private. It is not like X where people are dedicated to their accounts. You can create a new account on a dating app anytime. So if the code is public there is a risk of allowing someone to copy paste it, make small changes, and migrate users off my app to theirs. 

It's cool code though and I might post more here. Or a link to a code base walkthrough.
